# 1. Introduction to Node

## 1.1 What is Node ?

Node (or Node.js) is one of the most popular server-side framewoks. It's used and backed by huge companies like YouTube, Paypal, Netflix and so on...

Before entering into Node, let us see a very simplified version on how the internet works:
1. I open my Browser
2. I hit: www.9gag.com (for work purpose of course! üòÖ)
3. www.9gag.com replies with an HTML file

I don't work at **9gag** so I could not tell you how they did that, but one thing for sure is that: there have been a server-side programming language, maybe it is PHP... Ruby (‚ù§Ô∏è), Python... whatever.

That server-side language runs on a **Server**, and that language is responsible for taking care of my request and give me back what I asked for.

**Node** is one of those server-side languages. You'll soon tell me: "Oh, isn't it just JavaScript ? ü§ì".
The answer is "Yes and No".
